# Discord Bot With Node

## Initial Setup:

- Create a Discord account

  - Navigate to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

  - Set up a new BOT on your server
  - Acquire Client ID and Token from the OAuth2 section
  - Log the BOT in to the server

## Download:

NPM Install dependencies

- dotenv
- discord.js

## Usage:

Set up `permissions` in discord so that the BOT has a high role in the heirarchy.

The BOT (Lil' Discord Bot below) can be used to kick [`$kick`] or ban a user [`$ban`].

Webhooks can be added from the Server Settings.
